# Research Project: Vaccine-derived poliovirus modelling

This repository provides the MATLAB code used for the poliovirus modelling in the MA4k9 research project studying the control of vaccinde derived poliovirus (by Theo Maniura, student ID 1909643). The .m files with 'model' in the title are the models themselves, both deterministic and stochastic. The remaining .m files are the scripts that run these models to produce various plots for comparison. 

The workspace folders contain .mat MATLAB data files which contain the outputs of the .m scripts that were used to produce the plots as seen in the project report. This allows for recreation of the exact plots as seen in the report (since otherwise random variation will produce slightly different plots and figures). The folder title for the workspaces describes which script they were produced by.
